# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer for 5 rounds. The winner is determined based on the scores at the end.

## What I Learned

### 1. DOM Manipulation
- **`textContent`**: I used this to change the text in HTML elements, like showing scores and messages.
- **`querySelector`** and **`getElementById`**: I used these to grab buttons and sections of the page to update them.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  let displayMessage = document.getElementById("display-message");
